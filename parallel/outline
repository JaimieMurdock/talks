Practical Parallelism
Jaimie Murdock
CS Club Tech Talk
November 17, 2011

In this talk, I will give a brief overview of several key parallelism concepts
and practical tools for several languages. After this talk, attendees should
have the resources to recognize and solve "painfully parallel problems". Topics
will include: threads vs. processes, Amdahl's Law, shared vs. distributed
memory, synchronization, locks, pipes, queues, process pools, futures, OpenMP,
MapReduce, Hadoop, and GPU programming. 

Motivation
Parallelism is easy, especially w/functional background
Moving from HPC to mainstream SMP
- image of consumer processor cores
The Cloud

Basics
-------------
Amdahl's Law
-- chart
-- complexity O(n/k)

Simple Examples
Sum
Commutative, associative
    Map        Reduce

Synchronization
    Locks
    Deadlock

Shared vs. distributed memory
    local vs. global

Feeding data
    Pipes
    Queues

Process Models
---------------------
Threads

Processes

Pools

Libraries
---------------------
Futures

OpenMP

Hadoop

MapReduce

GPU Programming
---------------------
Memory Models

CUDA and OpenCL
